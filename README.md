Work in Progress

Extra scripts for running the four- five apllications required for Re:Puplica and the V&A

1. Cost of Speech to Text
   A simple counter running in python
  
2. WordCloud
   Either running as a standard wordcloud
   ...or running a cron job to refresh the server homepage
   ...or a new python script that replaces the image every 2 mins or so
  
3. Last Word
   Write something in python/Tkinter to flash up the last word heard
   
4. Confidence
   This runs in terminal in full screen mode.
